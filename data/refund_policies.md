## Horizon Air Comprehensive Refund & Cancellation Policy

At Horizon Air, we understand that travel plans can change unexpectedly. Our policy aims to provide clarity and fairness regarding ticket refunds, cancellations, and changes, balancing flexibility for our passengers with the operational realities of airline management. Please review the specific conditions of your purchased fare as these policies are subject to the fare rules associated with your ticket.

---

### **General Principles**

*   **Fare Rules Govern:** Every ticket purchased has specific "fare rules" attached to it, which dictate its flexibility, refundability, and changeability. These rules are presented during the booking process and are paramount.
*   **Ancillary Services:** Fees for services like seat selection, baggage, Wi-Fi, or lounge access are generally non-refundable once purchased, unless the flight is cancelled by Horizon Air.
*   **Processing Time:** Approved refunds will typically be processed within 7-20 business days for credit card payments and up to 30 days for other payment methods, appearing on your statement according to your bank's processing times.
*   **Original Form of Payment:** Refunds, when applicable, will be issued to the original form of payment used for the purchase.

### **1. Refundable vs. Non-Refundable Tickets**

Horizon Air offers various fare types to suit different travel needs and budgets. The core distinction lies in their refundability:

*   **Non-Refundable Tickets (e.g., Basic Economy, Standard Economy, some Premium Economy/Business Class fares):**
    *   **General Rule:** These tickets are **not eligible for a cash refund** if cancelled by the passenger, except under the "24-Hour Rule" (see below) or in specific "Special Circumstances."
    *   **Cancellation Outcome:** If a non-refundable ticket is cancelled by the passenger *outside* the 24-hour rule, its value (minus any applicable cancellation fees) may be retained as a travel credit or e-voucher for future use on Horizon Air. This credit is typically valid for 12 months from the original date of issue.
    *   **Lower Price Point:** Non-refundable tickets are generally offered at a lower price point due to their restrictive nature.

*   **Refundable Tickets (e.g., Flexible Economy, most Business Class, First Class fares):**
    *   **General Rule:** These tickets **are eligible for a full cash refund** to the original form of payment if cancelled by the passenger *before* the scheduled departure time of the first flight segment.
    *   **No Cancellation Fees:** There are typically no cancellation fees associated with refundable tickets.
    *   **Higher Price Point:** Refundable tickets are offered at a higher price point to accommodate the increased flexibility.

*   **The 24-Hour Rule (Applies to all tickets):**
    *   For flights to/from the United States, passengers may cancel their reservation and receive a **full refund** without penalty within **24 hours of purchase**, provided the purchase was made at least 7 days (168 hours) prior to the flight's scheduled departure. This applies to both refundable and non-refundable tickets.

### **2. Cancellation Timeframes and Fees**

The ability to cancel and the associated fees depend on your ticket type and when you cancel.

*   **Cancellation within 24 Hours of Booking:**
    *   **Fee:** $0 (Full refund applies, per the 24-Hour Rule, if conditions met).
    *   **Outcome:** Full cash refund.

*   **Cancellation of Non-Refundable Tickets (After 24-Hour Rule):**
    *   **Timeframe:** Must be cancelled *before* the scheduled departure of the first flight segment. "No-shows" forfeit the ticket value entirely.
    *   **Fees:**
        *   **Domestic Flights:** Typically **$99 - $250 USD** per passenger, per itinerary.
        *   **International Flights:** Typically **$200 - $400+ USD** per passenger, per itinerary (or equivalent in local currency).
    *   **Outcome:** The remaining value of the ticket (original fare minus the cancellation fee) will be issued as a non-transferable travel credit/e-voucher valid for future travel on Horizon Air.

*   **Cancellation of Refundable Tickets (After 24-Hour Rule):**
    *   **Timeframe:** Must be cancelled *before* the scheduled departure of the first flight segment.
    *   **Fees:** $0.
    *   **Outcome:** Full cash refund to the original form of payment.

*   **Partial Cancellations:** If you cancel a portion of a multi-segment itinerary (e.g., return leg), the remaining segments may be subject to recalculation based on the new itinerary's fare, and fees may apply.

### **3. Change Fees and Conditions**

Changing your flight involves modifying the date, time, or route of your existing booking.

*   **Changes to Non-Refundable Tickets:**
    *   **Fees:**
        *   **Domestic Flights:** Typically **$99 - $250 USD** per passenger, per change.
        *   **International Flights:** Typically **$200 - $400+ USD** per passenger, per change (or equivalent in local currency).
    *   **Fare Difference:** In addition to the change fee, you will be required to pay any **fare difference** if the new flight is more expensive than the original.
        *   If the new flight is *less* expensive, no refund is issued for the difference, and the original fare rules still apply to the remaining value.
    *   **Timeframe:** Changes must be made *before* the scheduled departure of the original flight. "No-shows" forfeit ticket value.

*   **Changes to Refundable Tickets:**
    *   **Fees:** Typically **$0** change fee.
    *   **Fare Difference:** You will be required to pay any **fare difference** if the new flight is more expensive. If the new flight is less expensive, the difference will typically be refunded to your original form of payment.
    *   **Timeframe:** Changes can generally be made up to the scheduled departure time.

*   **Name Changes:**
    *   **General Rule:** Name changes are generally **not permitted** on any ticket type, as tickets are non-transferable.
    *   **Minor Corrections:** Minor spelling corrections (e.g., correcting a typo) may be allowed at Horizon Air's discretion, often with an administrative fee (e.g., $50-$100) and require proof (e.g., passport copy).
    *   **Legal Name Change:** For legal name changes (e.g., marriage, divorce), documentation (e.g., marriage certificate, court order) is required, and approval is at Horizon Air's discretion. Fees may apply.

*   **Same-Day Changes:**
    *   For an additional fee (e.g., $75), eligible passengers (often those on higher fare classes or with elite status) may be able to change to an earlier or later flight on the same day, to the same destination, if seats are available. Fare difference may still apply.

### **4. Travel Insurance Recommendations**

Horizon Air highly recommends purchasing comprehensive travel insurance, especially for non-refundable tickets or complex itineraries.

*   **Protection Against Unforeseen Events:** Travel insurance can provide coverage for a wide range of unforeseen circumstances that are *not* covered by Horizon Air's standard policies, including:
    *   Medical emergencies or illness (of traveler or family member)
    *   Trip interruption or cancellation due to covered reasons (e.g., job loss, jury duty)
    *   Lost or delayed baggage
    *   Travel delays
*   **"Cancel For Any Reason" (CFAR) Policies:** Some premium travel insurance policies offer a "Cancel For Any Reason" (CFAR) benefit, which allows you to cancel your trip for a reason not typically covered by standard policies and receive a partial reimbursement (e.g., 50-75% of non-refundable costs). This is the most flexible, but also the most expensive, type of coverage.
*   **Airline's Role:** Horizon Air does not sell travel insurance directly and is not responsible for claims made under third-party insurance policies. Passengers must file claims directly with their insurance provider.

### **5. Special Circumstances (Waivers and Exceptions)**

Horizon Air understands that some situations are beyond your control. In specific, documented circumstances, we may offer waivers to our standard cancellation and change fees.

*   **Airline-Initiated Changes:**
    *   **Flight Cancellation by Horizon Air:** If Horizon Air cancels your flight, you are entitled to a full refund to the original form of payment, or free rebooking on the next available Horizon Air flight to your destination, or rebooking on a partner airline at no additional cost.
    *   **Significant Schedule Change or Delay:** If Horizon Air makes a significant schedule change (e.g., more than 3 hours difference in departure/arrival time) or incurs a significant delay (e.g., 3+ hours), you are entitled to a full refund if you choose not to travel, or free rebooking.
    *   **Diversions:** If your flight is diverted and you do not reach your final destination, you may be eligible for compensation or rebooking options.

*   **Medical Emergencies / Bereavement:**
    *   **Eligibility:** Applies to immediate family members (spouse, child, parent, sibling) of the passenger experiencing a severe medical emergency requiring hospitalization or death.
    *   **Documentation Required:** A doctor's note (for medical) or a death certificate/obituary (for bereavement) is required.
    *   **Waiver:** For non-refundable tickets, Horizon Air *may* waive the change/cancellation fee and allow the value to be used as a travel credit, or in some compassionate cases, offer a partial refund. Full refunds are typically only for refundable tickets.

*   **Government Travel Restrictions / Advisories:**
    *   If a government (domestic or international) issues a "Do Not Travel" advisory or imposes severe restrictions (e.g., mandatory quarantine, border closure) preventing travel to your destination, Horizon Air may issue a travel waiver.
    *   **Waiver Outcome:** Typically allows for free changes to an alternative date/destination, or a travel credit/e-voucher for future use. Cash refunds are generally at Horizon Air's discretion and based on the severity and duration of the restriction.

*   **Natural Disasters / Severe Weather:**
    *   When an airport is closed, or travel is severely impacted by a natural disaster (hurricane, blizzard, earthquake) or severe weather, Horizon Air will issue a **Travel Advisory/Waiver** for affected regions.
    *   **Waiver Outcome:** Allows passengers to change their flight dates or destination without change fees. Fare difference may still apply if changing to a significantly different route or a higher fare class. Cash refunds are typically only offered if Horizon Air cancels the flight.

*   **Military Orders:**
    *   Active duty military personnel who need to cancel or change travel due to official military orders may be eligible for a waiver of change/cancellation fees.
    *   **Documentation Required:** Official orders must be presented.
    *   **Waiver Outcome:** Often allows for free changes or a full refund (even on non-refundable tickets) for the service member and sometimes accompanying dependents.
